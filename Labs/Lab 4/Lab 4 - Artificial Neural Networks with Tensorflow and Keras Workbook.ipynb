    "# Introduction to TensorFlow and Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is Google's machine learning programing language. TensorFlow is a very general tools for constructing artificial neural networks, both as operation trees and as more topologically complicated networks. TensorFlow's nodes incorporate all of the structure we discussed in the lecture, including most importantly the reverse autodiff partial derivative information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that using TensorFlow for computations proceeds in two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Construct a graph:__ In this step, create a pattern for the network by defining all of our nodes (input, output, constant, multipliers, LSUs, etc) and connecting them. You also specify their initial values. At this stage no construction has been done. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Instantiate the model:__ Start a tensor flow __session__ and instantiate the model. An instantiation of the neural network actually creates a copy of all the variables in memory and stores their initial values in them. I\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Running the graph:__  Within the TensorFlow __session__, begin running/training the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tensors_flowing.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher level tools like Keras hide the details of the initialization and session and streamline this process by including pre-made versions of common architectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will consist of three parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Part 1__: First, we will show how to create a simple computational tree using TensorFlow and how to run it using a session. \n",
    "* __Part 2__: Second, we will create a single layer perceptron with TensorFlow and use it to classify the binary labeling.\n",
    "* __Part 3__: Finally, we will create a multilayer perceptron with TensorFlow and use it to classify the binary labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting TensorFlow and Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on Google Colab, TensorFlow and Keras are automatically installed. If you are running Jupyter locally use the anaconda prompt to install using \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip install tensorflow\n",
    "$ pip install keras\n",
    "\n",
    "* Windows: Open \"Anaconda Prompt\" from the start menu or from Cortana's search. \n",
    "* OSX: Open terminal, you should directly be able to use pip from there. \n",
    "* Linux: Open terminal, you should directly be able to use pip from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see https://www.tensorflow.org/install and https://keras.io/#installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab follows Chapters 9 and 10 from *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit_Learn & TensorFlow*.\n",

    "Train a deep MLP on the MNIST dataset (you can load it using `keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()`. See if you can get over 98% precision. Try searching for the optimal learning rate by using the approach presented in this chapter (i.e., by growing the learning rate exponentially, plotting the loss, and finding the point where the loss shoots up). Try adding all the bells and whistles—save checkpoints, use early stopping, and plot learning curves using TensorBoard.*"
